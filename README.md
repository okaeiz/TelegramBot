# TelegramBot
Here I share the codes that I used to develop a telegram bot.


First of all, we need to have a great log of what is going on in the bot.
We have to import just 2 modules:
  1. logging (which is used to send log messages to the terminal.)
  2. termcolor (which is used to beautify the log messages with colors and other text attributes.)
